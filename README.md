# **Equipment Management System (ASP.NET + MySQL)**

This project was developed to showcase my learnings in the Database Fundamentals course and aims to efficiently manage laboratory equipment, loans, students, projects, and employees within an academic institution.

The application is implemented with ASP.NET (C#) for the backend and SupaBase as the database management system. It includes a functional web interface that allows CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations on the various system entities, ensuring referential integrity between tables.

Key features include:

- Equipment registration and tracking, including availability.
- Student and project loan management.
- Laboratory, student, and employee management.
- Optimized SQL queries to generate specific reports (e.g., equipment loaned per laboratory or per student).
- Layered architecture (presentation, business logic, and data access).

This project demonstrates the practical use of concepts such as entity-relationship modeling, normalization, data integrity, foreign keys, and one-to-many relationships in a real web environment.
